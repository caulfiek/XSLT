XSLT - XML Transformations

This repository is where I keep my useful XSLT transformations.

In many cases I need to report on data that's specific to an application (say Control M) 
or thats embedded into a website (JIRA).

Generally there is a "save as" function but these tend to be badly formatted or simply not to my requirements.

This is where XSLT comes to the fore.
